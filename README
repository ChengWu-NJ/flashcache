License : Everything in flashcache components released under GPL v2.

Update : Added the flashcache-wt directory, which contains a
(separate) module for a write through flashcache. For more 
details, look at flashcache-wt/README.

Building Flashcache :
-------------------
Update : Vadim Tkachenko (with help from Mohan), ported 
Flashcache to later Linux releases. We now have built 
Flashcache on 2.6.18, 2.6.20 and 2.6.27-32. We have tested 
Flashcache on 2.6.18, 2.6.20, 2.6.27 and 2.6.32.

You'll need the entire kernel source tree in order to build
flashcache.

At the top directory, run

make KERNEL_TREE=<root of the kernel source tree>

This builds both the flashcache.ko and 3 utilities.

flascache-sa-guide.txt has details on how to create and load
flashcache volumes.
